          <p> This is a very limited applet.  If it were more advanced, there
          would be a larger number than "0.1" after the "v" up top. </p>

          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <p> You can draw only one thing: straight lines.  Lines, when put
          together, will be interpreted as one of 2 things:
          <ol>
            <li> Triangles: these will be turned into physical bodies. </li>
            <li> X's: When drawn over triangles, the triangles won't move.
            </li>
          </ol>
          You will probably want to draw a triangle or two, then hit the "Run"
          button.  When you're done watching the simulation, hit "Reset" and
          either play it again, or alter what you've drawn. </p>
          <p> I expect you to do the following:
          <ol>
            <li> Draw lines to create triangles. </li>
            <li> Draw X's over some of the triangles. </li>
            <li> Hit the "Run" button and watch. </li>
            <li> Hit the "Reset" button when you're done. </li>
          </ol>
